You receive `inputs` containing AVC/FSS/PSS as above.  
Contexts must map to domains in `fss.stories.tags` (`domain:*`) and responsibilities in AVC goals.  
Relationships should reflect upstream/downstream dependencies implied by PSS style (e.g., Event-Driven: consumer/producer).

Produce a single JSON object or array of CAM artifacts.
Each artifact MUST include:
- "schema_version": "1.0"
- "kind": "cam.context_map"
- "name": short title
- "data": {
  "contexts": [{ "name": "...", "responsibilities": [...], "owned_entities": [...] }],
  "relationships": [{ "from": "...", "to": "...", "style": "upstream/downstream/supplier/consumer", "notes": "..." }]
}
No prose; JSON only.
