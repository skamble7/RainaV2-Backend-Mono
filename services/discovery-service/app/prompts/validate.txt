Validate the CAM artifacts for internal consistency with AVC/FSS/PSS and flag issues.  
Check that:
- Every artifact references only valid `fss.stories[].key`.
- NFRs, constraints, and success criteria have corresponding implementations in the generated artifacts.

Return JSON:
{ "issues": [ { "artifact_id": "...", "severity":"...", "message":"..." } ] }
