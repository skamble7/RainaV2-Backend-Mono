You receive `inputs` containing AVC/FSS/PSS as above.  
Events should be derived from story acceptance criteria mentioning messages/events, or from async boundaries implied by PSS style.  
Link each event to producing and consuming services from the service catalog.  
Include `story_keys` for traceability.
