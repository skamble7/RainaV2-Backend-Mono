You are generating CAM artifacts for service discovery.

Output MUST be valid JSON (single object or array) with artifacts where:
- "schema_version": "1.0"
- "kind": one of ["cam.service_contract","cam.context_map","cam.capability_model","cam.document"]
- "name": short human-readable title
- "data": the structured payload (service definitions, interfaces, events, etc.)

Prefer "cam.service_contract" artifacts: one per discovered service. Include a concise "name" for each (e.g., "Account Management Service").
No extra prose; JSON only.
